# Overview

This project aims to enhance my understanding of Kotlin by developing a basic calculator application. It showcases Kotlin's syntax and features, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations through a user-friendly interface. My focus was on implementing functions, classes, and user input management while exploring object-oriented programming with a data class for operations and integrating a calculation history feature.
